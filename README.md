# Avoiding Predatory Lending (APL)

## Understand the problems with payday loans, one person at a time.

### Challenge Statement
Texas Appleseed promotes social, economic, and racial justice for all Texans by leveraging the skills and resources of volunteer lawyers, other professionals, and community partners to identify practical solutions to difficult, systemic problems.

Build an app to help educate potential customers, local leaders and partner organizations to understand the problems associated with payday loans. How can your app incentivize these constituents to steer others in their community away from predatory lenders?

As this application will be serving a very wide range of people, the application should be both desktop and mobile friendly (i.e. responsive web app). For the sake of this challenge, you can assume every user will have access to the internet.
